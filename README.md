# Core Angular Essentials App 🚀

## About the Project

This project was built as part of my Angular journey while completing **Maximilian Schwarzmüller's Angular Course** on Udemy.  
The goal of this app is to **explore and demonstrate** the most essential core concepts of Angular by building a simple but powerful web application.

It’s not just a demo — it’s a collection of important best practices, techniques, and fundamental Angular building blocks that every developer needs to master to create enterprise-level web applications.

## Why I Built This App

While learning Angular, it became clear that understanding **core concepts** deeply is crucial.  
Instead of just reading theory, I decided to **put everything into practice** by creating this app — applying concepts like component-driven architecture, event handling, services, dependency injection, two-way binding, dynamic styling, and more.

This app acts like a **playground** for experimenting and solidifying Angular knowledge.

## Key Angular Concepts Covered 🧠

Here’s a quick overview of the Angular features explored in this project:

- **What is Angular?**
  - A frontend framework + a rich collection of development tools.
- **Why Angular over Vanilla JS?**
  - Declarative programming, reusable components, better state management, TypeScript support, and separation of concerns.

### Core Topics Implemented

✅ **String Interpolation**: Display dynamic content inside the templates.

✅ **Property Binding**: Dynamically bind DOM properties like `src`, `alt`, etc.

✅ **Getters for Computed Values**: Cleanly derive dynamic data for templates.

✅ **Event Binding**: Handle user interactions declaratively inside the templates.

✅ **Managing State**: Reflecting UI changes automatically when data changes.

✅ **Change Detection**: Angular's automatic UI updates powered by `zone.js`.

✅ **Component Inputs (@Input)**: Passing dynamic data into reusable components.

✅ **Custom Outputs (@Output & EventEmitter)**: Emit custom events to parent components.

✅ **Dynamic CSS Styling**: Conditional class application with class binding.

✅ **Directives and Two-way Binding**: Using `ngModel` for seamless form management.

✅ **Content Projection (ng-content)**: Allowing flexible templates inside components.

✅ **Pipes**: Transforming template data (e.g., date formatting).

✅ **Services and Dependency Injection**:

- Centralizing business logic and data manipulation.
- Injecting services using constructor injection and `inject()` function.

✅ **Using Local Storage**: Persisting data across page reloads.
